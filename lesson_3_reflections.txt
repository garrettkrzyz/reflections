When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If multiple people are working on a project, it would be best to keep a remote repository.
It could be accessed by all people involved.  Also, if you work on multiple computers, it
may be beneficial to have access across multiple devices via GitHub remote repositories.
