When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

If multiple people are working on a project, it would be best to keep a remote 
repository.  It could be accessed by all people involved.  Also, if you work on 
multiple computers, it may be beneficial to have access across multiple devices
via GitHub remote repositories.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may be working on something locally, that is not in sync with the remote
repository.  Also, other people may be working on the remote repository, and
you don't know the changes that have been made.  It's best to make the decision
when to pull changes, rather than the local repository being automatically 
updated.
