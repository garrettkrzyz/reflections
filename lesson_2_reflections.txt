What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

An empty Git repository is initialized (git init).  It needs to be initialized
so that metadata of the files can be recorded and tracked, for purposes of 
version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository?  What value do you think it offers?

Local files are the working directory.  Changes made to the working directory
create 'modified files'.  The modified files you'd like to include in a commit 
are then moved to the staging area.  From there, you can commit the staged 
files.  A snapshot of all the files are then captured and stored as metadata
in the repository.  You can then checkout any commit, or snapshot, to your 
working directory.  This flow allows for a high degree of control over file
changes.
